# Telegram Bot User Interface for Singtel Manhole Project

During my stint at Amaris AI, I worked on the Singtel Manhole Project, one which focuses on the automation of work quality verification of a Singtel employee's underground cable installation. Image processing and machine learning techniques were implemented, and advanced algorithms were used to reference installation accuracy with its correspondning blueprint. Additionally, I was tasked to integrate my image processing and object detection back-end scripts with a Telegram Bot UI, which will be presented as a project demonstration to Singtel. 

The following video captures the workflow of the Telegram Bot, and how it caters to the employees working on underground cable installation. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JmFIXGBqMGg_IAj_7zGFuT6vXkMFr-RL
